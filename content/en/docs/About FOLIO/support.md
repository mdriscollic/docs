During the support period FOLIO provides critical service patches (CSPs), for details see [Critical Service Patch Process](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/REL/pages/5210770).

After the support period has ended no CSPs are provided. This also applies to critical security vulnerabilities. If possible plan to migrate to the next flower release before your current flower release reaches its end of support date.

For Ramsons there's a one-time exception: Security team will publish triage results of Ramsons security vulnerabilities until 2026-03-31, no fixes will be provided, institutions use Ramsons at their own risk after 2025-12-31.

All FOLIO releases before Ramsons are out of support, don't use in production!
