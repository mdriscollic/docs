The Lists app provides actionable lists in FOLIO at the point of need. Some use cases include:


- Create a custom list when a report isn’t available in FOLIO;
- Create lists of records across apps and record types;
- Enable actions and workflows on a list of records;
- Access a set of pre-generated (canned) lists.
- Perform a cross-tenant query in ECS-enabled tenants. See [Cross-tenant queries: Definitions, Functionality, Limitations](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13LzVYXMvx8eWvRDcqHk5hXTLP-tGJIGL/edit#slide=id.p5) for more information about **Cross-tenant queries**.


Functionality of the Lists app includes:


* Lists persist, can be refreshed and edited;
* List data updated in near real-time;
* User-friendly process for building a query to create a list;
* Duplication of lists;
* Export records from a list as a .csv file;
* Each list can include up to 1.25 million records.

- **Content permissions**. GET permissions that limit access to record types in Lists app (and FQM) based on the user’s assigned permissions to view record types in FOLIO.


## Permissions


**Lists app permissions** and **Content permissions** are applied together to determine a user’s access to the Lists app. See [Determining access in Lists app](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FOLIOtips/pages/572948576/Lists+App+permissions+-#Determining-access-in-Lists-app) for more information.


### Lists app permissions

The permissions listed below allow a user to interact with the Lists app and determine what the user can and cannot do within the app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Lists app or any related information. For more information on permissions, see [Platform Essentials \> Permissions](../platform-essentials/permissions/).


The following are the permissions for the Lists app:


- **Lists (Enable): Can view Lists**. This permission allows a user to view **Lists** and **List details**.
- **Lists (Edit): Can create, edit, and refresh lists**. This permission allows a user to view, create, edit, and refresh lists.
- **Lists (Export): Can create, edit, refresh, and export lists**. This permission allows a user to view, create, edit, refresh, and export lists.
- **Lists (Delete): Can create, edit, refresh, and delete lists**. This permission allows a user to view, create, edit, refresh, and delete lists. 
- **Lists (Admin): All permissions**. This permission allows a user to view, edit, refresh, export, and delete lists.

### Content permissions

**Content permissions** are GET permissions that limit access to Record types in Lists app (and FQM) based on the user’s assigned permission(s) to view record types in FOLIO. Content permissions ensure that sensitive and confidential data are available only to library staff who must have access to it. 

For a list of **Content permissions** by Record type, see [Lists app permissions: Content permissions](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FOLIOtips/pages/572948576/Lists+App+permissions+-#Content-permissions). 


## Supported fields by record type

In the Lists app, the **Fields** available for building a query and displaying as column headings depend on the selected **Record type** of the list. See the appropriate table for more information about supported fields by record type:

- [Holdings](#holdings)
- [Instances](#instances)
- [Items](#items)

## View a list


To view a list, open the Lists app. A list of Lists is displayed in the **Lists** pane. Select a list to view by highlighting and clicking on it. The selected list opens in a new window.


### Filters


The selection of lists in the **Lists** pane can be narrowed by applying filters. The following filters are available: 


- **Status**
  - **Active**. An active list contains a query and a resulting record set. 
  - **Inactive**. An inactive list contains a query but no record set.

- **Visibility**
  - **Shared:**. Shared lists can be accessed by all users with permissions to the Lists app in this organization. 
  - **Private**. Private lists can only be accessed by the user logged in.

- **Record Types**
  - **Holdings**. Record set includes holdings records.
  - **Instance**: Record set includes instance records.
  - **Items**: Record set includes item records. 
  - **Loans**: Record set includes loans.
  - **Organizations**: Record set includes organization information, such as contact information and agreements.
  - **Purchase order lines**: Record set includes information about purchase order lines (POLs).
  - **Users**: Record set includes user records.


### List information 


The **List information** section displays details about the list. 


- **Source**: Username or FOLIO account used to create and update the list.
- **List name**: Title of the list
- **Description**: A description of the list. This criteria is optional.
- **Visibility**: **Shared** or **Private**.  
- **Status**: **Active** or **Inactive**


### Query 


The **Query** section of the list displays the query string used to retrieve the record set. It also displays the number of records in the record set and a preview of the first 100 records in the record set.


### Field headings


In a list, the fields for the record set display as column headings. Customize the display of column headings in the record set by checking or unchecking the field(s) in **Actions \> Show columns** as appropriate. 


To view the refreshed list, click **Actions \> Refresh List** and click the **View updated list** link in the confirmation message.


## Create a list


A new list must have **List information** and a **Query** assigned to establish the record set for the list. A **Test query** must be performed before the query can be run and saved. 


### List information


To add list details for a new list:

### Build a query


The **Build query** function in the Lists app allows the user to build a query for these record types: **Holdings**, **Instances**, **Items**, **Loans**, **Organizations**, **Purchase order lines**, and **Users**. The query string populates in the **Query** field as the query is built. 


To set criteria and build a query for new list, follow these steps: 


1. Click the **Build query** button to open the **Build query** window. 
2. Select the **Record type** for the query. 
3. Select a **Field** from the **Filter options list** drop-down menu. The **Fields** available for selection are based on the **Record Type**. See [Supported fields by List record type](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FOLIOtips/pages/264831080/Supported+fields+by+List+record+type+Lists+app) for more information. 

4. Select an **Operator** from the **Select operator** drop-down list. The operators available for selection are based on the selected **Field**. 

| Operator | Meaning |
| :----- | :----- |
| *equals* | Field equals the selected Value. |
| *not equal to* | Field does not equal the selected Value. |
| *contains* | Field appears in the selected Value. |
| *starts with* | Field starts with selected Value. |
| *Is null/empty* | Field is empty; the Field contains no data.|
    

5. Select a **Value** from the **Select value** drop-down list. The **Values** available for selection are based on the **Record Type** and **Field**.
6. Click on the **+ icon** to add additional lines to the query; Click on the **trash can icon** to delete a line from the query. 
7. **Test query** is required whenever building a query for a new list. Click the **Test query** button to test the query. The total number of records retrieved and a preview of the first 100 records in the record set displays.
8. Click **Run query & save**. If saved successfully, a *(Name of List) saved successfully* message appears momentarily. Once the query is completed, a *Refresh complete with (number of) records: View updated list* displays at the top of the window.
9. Click the **View updated list** link in the confirmation message to view the record set in the list.
10. In a list, the fields of the record type display as column headings. The default display of column headings is based on the record type assigned to the list. Customize the display of column headings in the record set by checking or unchecking the field(s) in **Actions \> Show columns** as appropriate for the selected record type. See [Supported fields by List record type (Lists app)](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/x/aADJDw) for a list of column heading options.
