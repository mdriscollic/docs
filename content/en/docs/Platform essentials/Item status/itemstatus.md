FOLIO is implementing a three-part item state function. The three factors are Availability; Needed for; and Process.

Once developed, the three factors for item state will interact to drive functionality, and display status information on the item record. For example, an item that has an Availability value of “Checked Out” and a Needed for value of “Reserves” might trigger a process that routes the item to Course Reserves staff when returned, and prevent other patrons from requesting the item in the meantime.

Only Availability is currently implemented. In various FOLIO apps, it is labeled **Item status**.

### Availability

An item’s **availability** provides information about an item's location and whether it can be circulated. In FOLIO, availability is currently labeled **Item status**. 

Availability is a required value for an item. You cannot edit it directly. FOLIO processes, such as data import, ordering an item, checking an item in, or marking an item missing, set the availability value.

An item’s availability controls whether it can be loaned and whether it can be requested, even if the applicable circulation rule would otherwise allow the item to circulate.

### Needed for

**Needed for** is not yet implemented in FOLIO.

When implemented, **Needed for** will allow libraries to assign a workflow for an item to follow to meet specific staff or patron needs. Some examples where **Needed for** might be used include item requesting; placing items on course reserve; or sending an item for binding. **Needed for** will be an optional value.

### Process
**Process** is not yet implemented in FOLIO.

When implemented, **Process** will describe a staff process that an item is in. Common processes might include Digitization; Item Repair; or Cataloging. **Process** will be an optional value.

## How Item Status Changes During Circulation

If a FOLIO library relies on an item’s status to inform patrons and control how that item is used, library staff should be aware of how item statuses change as part of circulation (requesting, check out, and check in.)

* When a patron requests an item, the item status may change to **Paged**, or, if the item is currently on loan, it may change to **In transit** when the item is returned. 
* When a patron checks out an item, the item status will change to **Checked out**.
* When an item is checked in, the item status may change to **Available** or **In Transit**, depending on the status it has or where it is located when it is scanned in the Check In app. 
 
Items in some statuses will warn library staff members that the item status is going to change, and ask them to confirm check in before proceeding.

Importantly, FOLIO does not automatically reset an item status to what it was before it circulated. If your library uses item status to communicate information about an item, and then the item circulates, you will need to develop workflows to manually restore the item’s status once it is returned.                
{{% /alert %}}

For example:

Suppose a library decides to use the item status **Restricted** to indicate that a certain collection should only be used if patrons are pre-approved for access. If the library staff member then checks out an item with a **Restricted** status to an approved patron, the status of that item will change to **Checked out**. 

When the item is checked in, the status will change to **Available** or **In Transit**; FOLIO will not automatically change the status to **Restricted**. The library would need to use reporting tools or other workflows to identify the item when it is returned and change the status back to **Restricted**.
