The eUsage app allows you to manage usage data reports for electronic resources.

The app provides automatic harvesting of COUNTER standard usage reports via SUSHI and manual uploading of standard and non-standard statistics. Usage data providers managed in eUsage can be referred to from the Agreements app.


## Definition of terms

* **Aggregator**. A service that aggregates pre-processing statistics for multiple statistics providers and offers an endpoint to download the reports. eUsage allows you to harvest statistics for a usage data provider either directly from the provider via SUSHI or from an aggregator. The only aggregator service currently supported in FOLIO is the German National Statistics Server. 
* **COUNTER** and **SUSHI.** Standard format and protocol for electronic resource usage statistics. Detailed information is available at[ Project COUNTER](https://www.projectcounter.org/).
* **Report.** The usage data for a certain set of electronic resources within a certain reporting period in a specific type.
* **Usage data provider.** The agent that provides usage statistics for a set of electronic resources. Most likely, this is a vendor or a platform provider. The usage data provider record is the basic entity in eUsage used to manage all associated reports and harvesting processes.


## **Permissions**

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the eUsage app and determine what you can or cannot do within the app. You can assign permissions to users in the Users app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the eUsage app or any related information.

The following are all the eUsage permissions:


* **eUsage: All permissions.** Ths permission includes all other eUsage permissions.
* **eUsage: Can view usage data providers and view/download usage reports.** This is the eUsage read permission which allows the user to view usage data provider records and view and download the associated usage reports.
* **eUsage: Can create and edit usage data providers.** This permission allows the user to create and edit UDP records. It does not include the upload of usage reports to the provider.
* **eUsage: Can delete usage data providers.** This permission allows the user to delete UDP records. It does not include the deletion of the associated usage reports.
* **eUsage: Can upload usage reports.** This permission allows the user to upload COUNTER and non-COUNTER usage reports.
* **eUsage: Can start harvesting for a single provider.** This permission allows the user to start the harvester service for one UDP.
* **eUsage: Can delete usage reports.** This permission allows the user to delete COUNTER and non-COUNTER usage reports.
* **Settings (eUsage): Can view and edit settings.** This permission allows the user to view and edit the eUsage settings. It also includes starting the harvester for all usage data providers in the tenant.


## Creating a usage data provider

When you create a usage data provider, you are asked to enter the configuration details for automated harvesting. If the provider only supports manual data download, you still need to create a provider record in order to upload reports manually to this provider. For more information on manual report upload, see Uploading reports manually.

1. In the **Usage data provider** pane, click **New**.
2. In the **Create usage data provider** window, fill in the **Usage data provider information** and **Harvesting configuration** sections. For more information on the fields and actions available in these sections, see the section descriptions below.
3. Once you have included all of the information you want about the Usage data provider, click **Save & close**. The usage data provider is saved and added to the Usage data providers pane.


### Usage data provider information

* **Provider name (required).** Enter the name of the usage data provider.
* **Description.** A description of the usage data provider. You can use this field to enter additional information in order to identify the provider or any other data corresponding to the usage data provider or reports that should be displayed in a prominent place at the record.


### Harvesting configuration

* **Harvesting status (required).** Select a Harvesting status: Active or Inactive. The status you select here defines whether reports from the usage data provider are harvested in the automated or manually triggered harvesting processes.
* **Harvest statistics via (required).** Select how to harvest statistics: Aggregator or Sushi. Note: The only aggregator currently supported by FOLIO is the German National Statistics Server.
* **Aggregator (required).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via an aggregator, select the aggregator that should be used to harvest statistics. Note: The only aggregator currently supported by FOLIO is the German National Statistics Server.
* **Vendor code.** If you have selected to harvest statistics via an aggregator, enter the code by which the aggregator identifies the vendor for which statistics are requested. The German National Statistics Server requires the vendor names as displayed in the server’s user interface.
* **Service type (required).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via a SUSHI protocol, select the SUSHI service type implementation to be used by the harvester. The service type normally corresponds to the requested Report release. 
    * Counter-Sushi 4.1
    * Counter-Sushi 5.0
    * Counter-Sushi 5.1
* **Service URL (required).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via a SUSHI protocol, enter the URL to access the SUSHI service. The URL is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. \
Note: Only enter the_ base URL_ to the service, not the complete URL for an API request. For example, if the provider lists the URL[ https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi/reports/tr_b1](https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi/reports/tr_b1), only enter the part _before (and excluding) reports_:[ https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi](https://usage.catsanddogs.org/sushi). Everything else is added by the harvester.
* **Report release (required).** Select a Report release. Note: FOLIO does not support the simultaneous harvesting of reports of different releases for a usage data provider. If you want to harvest other report releases as it is configured, first reconfigure the harvester and select the desired release with the corresponding time period.
    * Counter 4
    * Counter 5
    * Counter 5.1
* **Requested report (required).** Add the report types requested to be harvested for the usage data provider. For more information, see Adding a report type.
* **Harvesting start (required)**. Enter the first month for the reports that are to be harvested.
* **Harvesting end.** Enter the last month for the reports that are to be harvested. Note: You may want to add an end month in case no more resources are licensed from a provider, a provider stops supporting usage statistics, or for any other reason that no ongoing harvesting is wanted. If no harvesting end is configured, reports are harvested continuously until the Harvesting status is changed to Inactive.
* **Customer ID (required for SUSHI).** If you have selected to harvest statistics via a SUSHI protocol, enter the customer ID assigned by the provider. This information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages.
* **Requestor ID.** Enter the Requestor ID assigned by the provider. If needed, this information is usually listed on the provider’s backend information pages. Not all SUSHI services require a Requestor ID.

## eUsage Reports (Plugin)

### Matching summary

When a new COUNTER report is harvested into the eUsage app, the eUsage Reports module creates matches between the titles in the COUNTER report and the titles that already exist in the Agreements local KB. Matching is done via ISSN or ISBN. If no matching ISSN or ISBN is found in the KB, then the title remains unmatched and can be manually addressed by a user.

Note that matching is only supported for the COUNTER 5 (or newer) TR report.

The eUsage Reports matching summary can be found in the eUsage app. This accordion appears on each eUsage provider record and provides a summary of the results of the matching process. The matching summary contains the following data:
* **Date of last harvest.** The date of the last COUNTER TR report harvest for that provider, whether manual or automated.
* **Status**
    * Reviewed: All titles have been reviewed and either matched or ignored.
    * Pending review: Some titles have not yet been matched or ignored.
    * No records: No counter data has yet been loaded.
* **Records loaded.** The number of titles found in COUNTER TR reports for the current provider.
* **Matched.** The number of COUNTER TR titles that have been matched to a KB title.
* **Unmatched.** The number of COUNTER TR titles that were not matched.
* **Ignored.** The number of titles have been manually flagged as ignored.


#### Working with matches

Clicking the hyperlinked numbers in the matching summary brings up the eUsage titles screen. This screen allows the user to review matched titles, create manual matches, and ignore titles that should not be matched. Each title in the list has an actions menu that provides the following options.


##### Editing titles

The edit option allows the user to manually choose a title from the local KB to match to a title found on a COUNTER TR report. Unmatched titles can be edited to select a match for the first time, and matched titles can be edited to change an existing match in case of error.

To edit:

1. Click the menu icon in the **Actions** column and select **Edit**.
2. Use the modal to search for a title in the local KB.
3. Click on the desired title to create the match.

Once a match is chosen, it will be used for all future harvests and reports. You will not need to manually rematch an unmatched title every time you load new data. Matches cannot be removed at this time. You may correct an error by changing the match, but you cannot reset a title to **Unmatched**.


##### Ignoring titles

There may be titles included on COUNTER TR reports that appear in error or are not of interest. If you don't want to include these titles in your reports or go through the trouble of matching them, you can ignore them. Ignored titles will not be shown in your matched or unmatched counts or cause a provider to be marked as **pending review**.

To ignore:

1. Click the menu icon in the **Actions** column and select **Ignore**.
2. Your title will be ignored.
3. To remove a title from the Ignored list, select the Actions menu and choose **Stop ignoring**.


#### Updating matches

The **Update matches** button triggers the eUsage Reports module to process any new COUNTER report data that has become available since the last harvest. If new titles have come in, they will either be matched automatically or added to the unmatched list. 

Note that for new data to be included in the eUsage Reports visualizations, you must update matches before analyzing an agreement or viewing a report.


### eUsage Reports (Agreements)

eUsage Reports appear in an accordion on the Agreement record in the Agreements app. These reports include COUNTER and financial data about the titles that are part of a given agreement. The reports will include titles directly associated with an agreement line and titles associated with an agreement line via a package.

For eUsage reports to function properly, you must meet the following requirements:

1. Associate an eUsage provider record with your agreement in the Usage data section.
2. Harvest at least one COUNTER 5 TR report for this provider using the eUsage app.
3. Update matches for the provider in the eUsage app.
4. Review matches and ensure all titles of importance are matched to a title in the KB.

Each eUsage report includes a set of parameters for the user to define a visualization, and a downloadable CSV file containing the data used to generate the visualization.

#### Cost per use

This report displays an average cost per use for a given time period. The yellow line displays the number title with usage that were present in an agreement during each period. 


##### Calculation

The cost per use metric uses paid invoice totals from the Invoices module to determine the cost of an agreement. For the cost per use report to function, you must link your agreement lines to a purchase order with at least one paid invoice.

Cost per use is calculated using the following methods:

* **Cost:**
    * Cost is sourced from any paid invoices associated with an agreement line via the linked purchase order line.
    * Cost is reported by the subscription dates defined on the invoice record. If no subscription dates are present, then the fiscal year dates are used as a fallback.
    * If a report is requested at a finer lever of granularity than the available subscription/fiscal year dates, the cost will be prorated by dividing it equally across the number of months in the period of use.
    * The cost is also prorated by dividing the total across the number of years of publication for which use has occurred. An aggregate view can be created by summing the total for all years of publication.
    * If the agreement line is for a single title, then there is a one-to-one relationship between the title and the payment.
    * If the agreement is for a package, then the total cost is divided equally across all titles in the page.
* **Use**
    * Use is sourced from the counter reports associated with a title.
    * Use is reported by the month, but can be aggregated into larger groups.
* **Cost per use**
    * Cost per use is calculated by dividing the cost for a given period of use and year of publication by the number of uses in that period.
    * On the downloadable version of this report, a separate report line is included for each unique combination of Title + Year of publication + Subscription/Fiscal year period.


##### Parameters

* **Format:** Journals or books, identified by the **publication type** field in the KB.
* **Start month:** The earliest month of data to be included in the report.
* **End month:** The last month of data to be included in the report.
* **Include Open Access use?**
    * Yes - includes use identified as **Gold_OA** in the source COUNTER report.
    * No - excludes use identified as **Gold_OA** in the source COUNTER report.
* **Count type:** Not applicable for this report, because both total and unique usage are displayed at all times.
* **Scale: Select interval for period of use:** Determines the scale of the x-axis by setting the grouping level for period of use.


##### Report data

* **Title:** The title of the resource as it appears in the local KB.
* **Derived title:** A derived title is a title that is related to the Agreement and any related purchases by way of a package. The cost of these titles is derived from the total cost of the package by splitting the cost evenly.
* **Print ISSN:** The print ISSN of the resource as it appears in the local KB, if available.
* **Online ISSN:** The online ISSN of the resource as it appears in the local KB, if available.
* **ISBN:** The ISBN of the resource as it appears in the local KB, if available.
* **Year of publication:** The year of publication for the journal article that was accessed.
* **Order type:** The order type as it appears on the linked purchase order. Possible values include **one-time** and **ongoing**.
* **Purchase order line:** The purchase order line number associated with the title. This is sourced from the agreement line-POL relationship defined on the Agreement record.
* **Invoice number:** The invoice line number associated with the the purchase order line.
* **Fiscal year start:** The first date of the fiscal year in which the invoice was paid. Fiscal year dates are derived from the Fiscal Year record in the Finance app that corresponds to the date the invoice was paid.
* **Fiscal year end:** The last date of the fiscal year in which the invoice was paid. Fiscal year dates are derived from the Fiscal Year record in the Finance app that corresponds to the date the invoice was paid.
* **Subscription start:** The subscription start date as it appears on the invoice line record.
* **Subscription end:** The subscription start date as it appears on the invoice line record.
* **Amount encumbered:** The total of any outstanding encumbrances on a related purchase order line. Encumbrances are displayed for informational purposes only and are not considered in the cost per use calculation.
* **Amount paid:** The total amount paid on the invoice line that is linked to a related purchase order line.
* **Metric type:** The type of metric used to generate the usage count.
    * Total_Item_Requests: Total number of times a content item was requested; includes duplicate requests for the same item during a single session.
    * Unique_Item_Requests: Number of unique content items requested; excludes duplicate requests for the same item during a single session.
* **Reporting period total:** The sum of all COUNTER uses that occurred on or between the start and end dates defined in the report parameters.
* **Period of use totals:** The number of COUNTER uses broken down by the interval defined in the scale parameter. This may be presented as a year (e.g., 2019), a span (e.g., 2019-01-2019-12) or a month (2019-01).
