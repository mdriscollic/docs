The Users app allows you to manage user information for patrons and library staff. Both patrons and library staff's user records are stored in the Users app. There is no separate directory or app for library staff users. The difference between a library staff user and a patron is that the library staff user record has FOLIO permission(s), username, and  assigned to it. 

Definition of terms related to the Users app:

- **applicationId**. Also referred to as **Application**. An attribute of a capability or capability set that identifies the platform for a FOLIO application.
- **Application**. See **applicationID**. For Users capabilities and capability sets, the Application is *app-platform-complete*.
- **Authorization role**. See **User role**.
- **Capabilities**. Ability assigned to a user to perform an action in a FOLIO application.  
- **Capability Sets**. A set of individual capabilities.
- **permissionDisplayName (OKAPI)**. The permission set name displayed in the Okapi platform (pre-Sunflower release). 
-  **Resource (EUREKA)**. An operation that can be performed in a FOLIO application.
- **Type (Data)**. Capabilities that allow the user to directly manage resources in FOLIO.
- **Type (Procedural)**. Capabilities that allow the user to initiate and control processes in FOLIO.
- **Type (Settings)**. Capabilities that allow the user to manage FOLIO configurations administratively.
-  **User.** Any person who interacts with or performs tasks in FOLIO.
-  **User record.** Contains contact information and identifiers for an individual user. User records exist for both patrons and library staff. For a list of all information contained within a user record, see [View a user record](#view-a-user-record).
-  **User role.** Also known as **Authorization role**. Comprised of capabilities or capability sets, allows a user to perform role-based actions in a FOLIO application.


## Capabilities and Capability Sets

The Eureka platform, adopted in the Sunflower release, replaces permission sets with **Capabilities** and **Capability sets** for role-based management of user accounts. For more information about **Capabilities** and **Capability sets**, see [Roles Management with Eureka](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BIATLw).

The following **Capabilities** allow interaction with the Users app. 

For all Users capabilities:

- **Application** is *app-platform-complete*.

    -  **Active** status indicates current affiliation, employment, or enrollment at the library's institution. 
    -  **Inactive** status indicates that the expiration date on the user's record has passed or the user is no longer affiliated, employed, or enrolled at the library's institution.

Otherwise, use of the **User type** field is optional.
    -  **Patrons.** Users who may borrow library materials but have no FOLIO permissions assigned to their User record and do not log in to FOLIO to manage their library accounts.

If the renewal is not successful, a pop-up message will appear. If you have the correct permissions, you can click **Override** from the pop-up window to override the error and renew the loan.


### Mark an item claim returned


Occasionally, patrons may claim that they have returned items that are still listed as checked out to them. The library has the option to mark the item as “claim returned.” This will place any associated fines in a suspended state while libraries carry out workflows to search for the item on their shelves.

5. Click **Confirm**.


The loan will remain in the patron’s list of open loans, but the item status will change to **Claim returned**.


If the library cannot locate the claimed returned item, it will decide whether to bill the patron for the item or mark the item missing without charging fines. In FOLIO, this action is referred to as resolving a claim.


To resolve a claim on an item:


1. Click the appropriate loan to open the *Loan details* window.
2. Click the button marked **Resolve claim** on the top row.

Note that if you have permissions to change a loan’s due date, you can change the due date/time to one in the past. FOLIO will give you a warning message but allow the change to go through.


### Mark an item Declared lost


FOLIO has two options to show that an item has been borrowed and not returned - “aged to lost” and “declared lost.” Aged to lost is an automated status that FOLIO gives to an item when the item is not returned by the date specified in the lost item policy. Declared lost is a manual status that library staff can use when a patron tells the library that they cannot return the item because they can no longer find it or because it had been inadvertently damaged.


Library staff can only mark one loan declared lost at a time.


To mark a loan declared lost:


1. Click the appropriate loan to open the *Loan details* window.

### Mark a fee/fine as error (Cancel fee/fine)


Staff with appropriate permissions can mark a fee/fine as an error which has the effect of canceling the fee/fine.


Note that an error can only be applied to a fine in an **Outstanding** payment status. Marking a fine as an error is intended to be used when the fine is charged as a result of a staff or system error and as such none of it should be paid.


1. [Find the user record](#search-for-user-records) to which you want to refund a payment and click it.
2. In the **User details** pane, expand the **Fees/fines** accordion if needed.
3. Select **View all fees/fines** to view the patron’s fines.
4. The **Fees/fines** modal will open. Click the fee/fine you wish to refund a payment for. It may be **Open** or **Closed**.
5. The **Fee/fine details** modal will open. Click **Actions \> Error**.
6. The **Confirm fee/fine cancellation** modal will open. Enter **Additional information for staff** (required).
7. Click **Confirm**.

The modal will close, and the **Fee/fine details** page will update with the cancellation transaction.


## Processing lost items requiring actual cost


Libraries may choose to use **Actual cost** for some or all of the fines that they charge patrons. With the actual cost model, libraries review each loan after it ages to lost in order to charge the patron a specific amount for the item, rather than a flat amount based on the associated loan policy. For more information, see [Lost items - charging set cost versus actual cost](../access/additional-topics/feesfines/feesfines/#lost-items---charging-set-cost-versus-actual-cost
).

### Applying a bill for an actual cost list item


In order to bill a patron the actual cost for a lost item, you first search for the loss record. Once you have located the record you want to apply the bill for:


1. Find the loss record for the item you wish to bill. Click **Actions \> Bill actual cost**.
2. On the **Actual cost to bill** modal, input the amount to bill. Include **Additional information for staff** and **Additional information for patron** if desired. Click **Continue**.
3. A confirmation modal will appear. If you wish to change anything, click **Keep editing** to return to the previous modal. To proceed and bill the patron, click **Confirm**.


Once you confirm billing the patron, you will see **Billed** appear in the actions column with the amount charged. If you refresh the page or close your browser tab, the next time you open the **Lost items regarding actual cost** modal, the lost item record will no longer appear in the list of items to review.


### Processing an actual cost item without billing the patron


There will be cases when libraries will decide not to bill a patron for the lost item, but still need to process and close the charge.


To mark a lost item record as “Do not bill”:


1. Find the loss record for the item you wish to mark “Do not bill.” Click **Actions \> Do not bill**.
2. On the **Do not bill** modal, input **Additional information for staff** if desired. Click **Continue**.
3. A confirmation modal will appear. Review the information. If you wish to change anything, click **Keep editing** to return to the previous modal. To proceed with not billing the patron, click **Confirm**.


If you proceed with not billing the patron, you will see **Not billed** appear in the **Actions** column for that record. If you refresh the page or close your browser tab, the next time you open the **Lost items regarding actual cost** modal, the charge that you decided not to bill will no longer be visible in the Users app.


Note that if you choose **Do not bill** and the patron did not also have a lost item processing fee, that marking the lost item record as **Do not bill** will close the loan and change the item status to **Lost and paid**. FOLIO does not currently differentiate item statuses to indicate if an item was lost and the patron paid for it, or if the item was lost and the patron did not pay for it.
