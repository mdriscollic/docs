The Reading room access app allows you to approve or deny access to Reading rooms. Reading rooms are created in [Settings > Tenant > Reading room access](../../../settings/settings_tenant/settings_tenant/#settings--tenant--reading-room-access). You can edit a user’s [Reading room access](../../../users/#reading-room-access) and [Reading room notes](../../../users/#reading-room-access) in the Users app. 

## Permissions
The permissions / capabilities listed below allow you to interact with the Reading room app and determine what you can and cannot do within the app. You can assign User roles to users in the Users app, or in the Settings > Authorization roles app. If the first capability is not assigned to a user, then they will be unable to see the Reading room access app or any related information.

To add a capability or capability set to an Authorization role: 

Select all applications to ensure access to all capabilities.
1. Open the Capability sets or Capability accordion (see description in the table below for whether to look for a Capability set or a Capability).
2. Look under the matching Type.
3. Find the Resource (you can search using Ctrl-f/Cmd-f).
4. Select the Action.

See [Settings > Authorization roles](../../../settings/settings_authorization-roles/settings_authorization-roles) for instructions on how to create and assign Authorization roles.

The following are all the Reading room permissions:

## Locating a patron in the system
You need to be signed into a service point the reading room is associated with before looking up a patron. 

You can find the patron by either:

* Scanning / entering the barcode provided by the patron.
* Using the Patron Look-up function.

Locate the patron using a barcode:

1. Either scan the barcode on the patron’s library card, or enter the patron barcode number.
2. Click **Enter**. Patron details are displayed. The access status to the Reading room associated with the logged in user’s service point is shown.

Locate the patron using the Patron look-up function:
1. In the Scan patron card pane, click **Patron look-up**.
2. In the **Select User** dialog, in the **User search** box, enter part or all of the patron’s name, email, or username.
3. Optional: Filter results by Status (active/inactive), or by Patron group.
4. Click **Search**.
5. Click the patron to use. The Select User dialog closes, the barcode appears in the Scan patron card pane, and the patron details are displayed. The access status to the Reading room associated with the logged in user’s service point is shown.

Note: Unlike in the **Check out** app, Patron look-up will only return results if the patron has a barcode. 

## Allowing reading room access

1. [Look up the patron](#locating-a-patron-in-the-system).
2. You will see the patron’s reading room access (**allowed** or **not allowed**) and any notes.
3. Select **Allowed** or **Not allowed**.

Note: Inactive users will display an Inactive user message under their patron details. The allowed and not allowed buttons do not display for inactive users.

You can access the log of approvals and denials via the **/reading-room/access-log** API endpoint.
