The Circulation log app allows you to view and search for some circulation actions. Circulation actions are actions performed by the system or a user within the following Circulation apps: Check in, Check out, and Requests. Notices and fee/fine actions are also included.

## Permissions

The permissions / capabilities listed below allow you to interact with the Circulation log app and determine what you can and cannot do within the app. You can assign User roles to users in the Users app, or in the Settings > Authorization roles app. You need to assign at least one of the following capabilities to a user to enable the user to see the Circulation log app or any related information.


To add a capability or capability set to an Authorization role: 

Select all applications to ensure access to all capabilities.
1. Open the Capability sets or Capability accordion (see description in the table below for whether to look for a Capability set or a Capability).
2. Look under the matching Type.
3. Find the Resource (you can search using Ctrl-f/Cmd-f).
4. Select the Action.

See [Settings > Authorization roles](../../../settings/settings_authorization-roles/settings_authorization-roles) for instructions on how to create and assign Authorization roles.

## Getting additional circulation action information

Clicking the **...** in the Action column displays a menu that enables access to additional information. The menu options that appear differ depending upon the **[Object](#columns-in-the-circulation-log)** (Fee/fine, Loan, Manual block, Notice, or Request). For example, clicking **... > Item details** opens the Inventory app for more information. In some cases the **...** may not appear, e.g., when a loan has been anonymized.

## Exporting circulation log search results

If your search for circulation log records returns results, you can export those results to a CSV file.

1. Click the **Actions** menu.
2. Select **Export results (CSV)**.

A green success toast message informs you that you have generated the export file. Once generated, the file downloads automatically.

If you do not receive the download file, check that your browser did not block the pop-up window. If the pop-up was blocked, change your browser to allow pop-ups, and export your circulation log search results again. You may also be able to access your download through the Export Manager app if you have permission to view that app.
