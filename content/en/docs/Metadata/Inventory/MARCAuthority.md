## Creating MARC authority records 

### Creating new MARC authority records via Data Import

MARC authority records can be created via [Data import](../../data-import/). To create one or more authority records via Data Import, see instructions on [starting a data import job](../../data-import/#starting-a-data-import-job).

### Creating new MARC authority records in the MARC Authority app (via quickMARC)

To create a new authority record in the MARC authority app, follow these steps:

1. Open the **MARC authority app**.
2. Click **Actions \> New**.
3. Follow instructions for [editing authority records via quickMARC](#editing-marc-authority-records-via-quickmarc).

## Editing MARC authority records 

### Updating MARC authority records via [Data import](../../data-import/)

MARC authority records can be updated via [Data import](../../data-import/). To update one or more authority records via Data Import, see instructions on [starting a data import job](../../data-import/#starting-a-data-import-job).

### Editing MARC authority records via quickMARC

When viewing the MARC authority record you wish to edit, click **Edit** in the upper right. The record opens in edit mode. 

In the Edit MARC authority record window, you can perform the following actions:

-   **Add a field.** To add a field, click the **+**. The new field appears below.
-   **Delete a field.** To delete a field, click the **trash can icon**. The field is deleted.
-   **Move a field up.** To move a field up, click the **up arrow** in the row of the field you want to move. The field is moved one row up.
-   **Move a field down.** To move a field down, click the **down arrow** in the row of the field you want to move. The field is moved one row down.
-   **Edit text within a field.** Click into a field to make changes to the text. To add a literal dollar sign (\$) (i.e., not a subfield delimiter) in a field, enter {dollar}.
-   Once you have made your desired changes, click **Save & close**. A confirmation message appears, and the record is updated.

### Validations and restrictions
 
A subfield is defined by a \$ (dollar sign).  
Tags must consist of 3 numeric characters.  
Indicators must consist of single characters.

The following additional validation rules and restrictions apply:

-   The leader (LDR) field can be edited via dropdown menus under each position. Only Record status (Status, corresponds with position 05), Type of record (Type, position 06), Encoding Level (Elvl, position 17), and Punctuation policy (Punct, position 18) can be edited. Type of record (position 06) must contain a value of "z".
-   Fields 001 and 999ff are system supplied and cannot be edited or deleted.
-   Field 001 is non-repeatable.
-   Field 010 is non-repeatable and can only contain one \$a.
-   1xx is required and non-repeatable.
-   By default, no other validation is performed. Additional validation rules can be configured at the tenant level via the mod-record-specifications API (see the [developer documentation](https://dev.folio.org/source-code/map/#mod-record-specifications)).

Note that validation rules are only applied when creating or editing an authority record in quickMARC, not when records are imported via the Data import app.

It contains the following fields: date and time that the authority record was last updated, original heading, new heading, original 1XX, new 1XX, authority source file name, number of bibliographic records linked, and the FOLIO account name of the record updater.
