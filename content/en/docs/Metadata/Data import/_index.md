## Capabilities

The capabilities listed below allow you view and interact with the Data import app. You can assign capabilities to users via user roles. If none of these capabilities are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Data Import app or any related information.

See [Settings > Authorization roles](../../../settings/settings_authorization-roles/settings_authorization-roles) for instructions on how to create and assign Authorization roles. It is recommended that you select all applications prior to assigning capabilities to ensure you have access to all capabilities.

Note: The below capabilities only pertain to the Data Import app. Data Import processes involve other apps and the ability to interact with those could require separate capabilities.

|**Permission Display name (OKAPI)** | **Resource (EUREKA)** | Type | Action | Description |
| -------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
|**Data import: Can upload files, import, and view logs** | **UI-Data-Import** | data | manage | This capability allows the user to see and use the Data import app. The user can perform all functions other than deleting logs.|
|**Data import: Can delete import logs** | **UI-Data-Import Logs** | data | delete | This capability allows the user to delete logs in the Data import app.|
|**Data import: Can view only** | **UI-Data-Import** | data | view | Assign this capability if a user only needs to view logs and details of import jobs (e.g. check to see if an import has completed) but is NOT permitted to import files using the Data Import app.|


## Starting a data import job

The Data import app accepts MARC and EDIFACT files for import.

1.  In the **Jobs** pane, either drag and drop your file into the box, or click **or choose files** to locate the file on your computer. Note that the file must have one of the permitted file extensions that are defined in the Settings App for Data Import.
2.  In the **Job profiles** window, select the job profile to run. If the list is long, you can search for job profiles by using the search bar at the top of the window to search through the Name and Description fields. To search for job profiles, enter terms in the search box and click **Search**.
3.  In the **job profile details** pane, click **Actions \> Run**.
4.  In the **Are you sure you want to run this job** dialog, click **Run**. The window closes and the job status appears in the Jobs pane.

### Assessing the job profile

After selecting a profile, you can see more details about the profile in the right pane. You can see the Name, Accepted data type, Description, Tags, Overview, which has the attached Action profiles, and a list of previous Jobs using this profile. Clicking on an Action profile opens that profile in the Settings app.

## Viewing import logs

Once an import is completed, whether it was completed without any errors, completed with errors, or failed, it appears in the Logs table in the Logs pane.

The Logs table contains the following columns:

-   **File name.** Name of the file that was imported. If the import was a single record import then **no file name** appears in the File name column.
-   **Status.** Status of the import:: Completed, Completed with errors, or Fail.
-   **Records.** Number of records in the import.
-   **Job profile.** Name of the job profile used.
-   **Started running.** Date and time the import started.
-   **Ended running.** Date and time the import finished.
-   **Run by.** User or system by which the import was generated.
-   **ID.** Identification number of the import.

You can click on any column name to sort by that column.

### Viewing all logs

Logs are never deleted unless a user with appropriate permission selects a log for deletion. Users need the permission **Can delete import logs** in order to delete log entries.

The most recent logs for imports other than single record imports are displayed in the Logs list in the Logs pane when you first select the Data Import app. To view all logs, in the **Logs** pane, click **Actions** then select **View all**.

#### Searching and filtering logs

After viewing all logs, you can search for files in the **Search & filter** pane. To search for a file, enter your search terms into the box. Select the **Keyword** drop-down list to search through one of the following fields:

-   **Keyword (ID, File name).** Keyword search through the ID and File name fields.
-   **ID.** Identification of the import.
-   **File name.** Name of the import file.

You can also search for logs by selecting any of the filters in the **Search & filter** pane. Additionally, you can apply the filters after you perform a search to limit your results. See the sections below for more information.

##### Inventory single record imports

Single record imports are MARC records loaded from an external source, like OCLC. These records are imported through the Inventory app, but the logs appear in Data import.

-   **No.** All other types of logs.
-   **Yes.** Logs for Inventory single record imports.

## Retrieving data import results

For all imports with the Status of *Completed* or *Completed with errors*, you can click on the **File name** in the Logs pane to retrieve your data import results. You are presented with a summary of records created, updated, discarded or in error. Clicking on the title link will display the system error if the import failed.

## Troubleshooting failed imports

For all imports with the Status of *Failed* or *Completed with errors*, click in the **row** of the import to view the error log. For all failed imports, a record is not created or updated.
