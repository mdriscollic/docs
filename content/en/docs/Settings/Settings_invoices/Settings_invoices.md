The Invoices section of the Settings app is where you establish one click approvals, create preset adjustments, manage and configure batch groups, and control voucher settings.

## Settings > Invoices > Batch group configuration

Use this setting to configure batch group voucher exports. This configuration enables you to setup automated exports of files containing all invoice vouchers created since the last export. For more information about how vouchers are created, see  [Invoices > Approving an invoice](../../invoices/#approving-an-invoice).  All vouchers with the **Export to accounting** checkbox selected that were created since the last export for the batch group will be exported to a file. For more information about the Export to accounting checkbox, see  [Invoices > Extended information](../../invoices/#extended-information).  Each invoice generates a single unique voucher on which all fund charges are grouped by the fund external account number. 



### Configuring a batch group

1. Select a **Batch group.**
2. Select a **Location type.** FTP or SFTP.
3. Enter an **Upload location.** If this box is left blank, the export downloads the file to your computer.
4. Enter a **Port**, if needed for the file upload location.
5. Enter a **Directory**, if needed for the file upload location (e.g. /files).
6. Select a **Format.** JSON or XML. 
7. Enter a **Username**, if needed for the file upload location.
8. Enter a **Password**, if needed for the file upload location. 
9. Click **Save**. 

Click **Show credentials/Hide credentials** to show or hide the password. If you want to test the connection with the upload location, click **Test connection**.

3. Click **Reset sequence** if you need to reset the voucher number. 
4. Select the **Allow voucher number to be edited** checkbox if you want to allow editing for the voucher number.
