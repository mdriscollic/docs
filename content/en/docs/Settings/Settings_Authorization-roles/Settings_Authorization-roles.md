## Permission name/displayName to capabilities mapper

The Eureka platform, adopted in the Sunflower release, replaces permission sets with **Capabilities** and **Capability sets** for role-based management of user accounts. **Permission** names in the Okapi platform (pre-Sunflower release) differ from **Capabilities** in the Eureka platform. 

The Authorization Roles section of Settings allows configuration and management of **Authorization roles**, also known as user roles, through capabilities and capability sets. For more information about **Capabilities** and **Capability sets**, see [Roles Management in Eureka](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/x/BIATLw).

To map **Permission** names to **Capabilities** and identify their attributes, use the **Permission name/displayName to capabilities mapper** in the Settings \> Developer app: 

1. Log in as an admin user in the Sunflower Bugfest environment: https://bugfest-sunflower.int.aws.folio.org (folio folio) .
2. Open **Settings \> Developer**.
3. Select **I can haz capabilities?** in the **Developer* pane.
4. Type the **Permission name** in the search box in the **Capabilities* pane. 

    - Keyword or exact phrase (including punctuation) searches work best. For example, use *requests* or *Users: View requests* to search for the **Capability** that allows users to view requests.
    
5. Select **permissionDisplayname** in the **Search by** drop-down menu, if necessary. This filter searches for **Permission names** as they are displayed in the Okapi UI.
6. Click **Search**. A list of **Capabilities** and/or **Capability Sets** and their attributes display in the **Capabilities** pane. 

    - Search results show the attributes (**type**, **applicationId**, **resource**, **action**, and **permissionDisplayName**) for each capability and capability set.
    - If no results are found, a blank space appears under the **Search by** drop-down menu.
    - If there are many search results, use CTRL+F to quickly find a specific capability or capability set. 

7. Use these attributes to [create an **Authorization role**](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/789807108/Roles+Management+with+Eureka#Role-Creation). 

## Create an authorization role

To assign **Capabilities** or **Capability sets** to a user record, you must first create an **Authorization role**. 

To create an **Authorization role**, follow the steps outlined in [Role Creation](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/789807108/Roles+Management+with+Eureka#Role-Creation).

## Assign or unassign an Authorization role

Management of role assignments can be done in several FOLIO applications: Settings \> Authorization roles, Users, or Consortia manager. See [Managing Role Assignments](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/789807108/Roles+Management+with+Eureka#Managing-Role-Assignments) for more information.

## Edit an Authorization role

See [Role modification](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/789807108/Roles+Management+with+Eureka#Role-Modification).

## Duplicate an Authorization role

See [Role Duplication](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/789807108/Roles+Management+with+Eureka#Role-Duplication). 

## Delete an Authorization role

See [Role Deletion](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/UM/pages/789807108/Roles+Management+with+Eureka#Role-Deletion).
