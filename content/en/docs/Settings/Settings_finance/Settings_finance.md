## Settings > Finance > Fund types

A fund type is a categorization to help distinguish between the purpose of the different funds. You can use fund types to track the types of items funds are applied to, such as gifts, endowments, and exchanges. You need to first add the fund types in the Settings app in order to assign them to funds as fund types are created within the system. Fiscal year rollover of funds is often defined by fund type, so definition of the type values should consider future fiscal year rollover requirements.
