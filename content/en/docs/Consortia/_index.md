The Consortium manager app allows libraries to share data and settings between multiple FOLIO tenants. A FOLIO tenant must be implemented with **Enhanced Consortial Support (ECS)** enabled in order to use Consortium manager. For more information about setting up an ECS-enabled tenant, see [Steps to setup Consortia environment](https://wiki.folio.org/display/FOLIJET/Steps+to+setup+Consortia+env).


Definitions of terms related to Consortium manager:


* **Affiliation**: Association with a given tenant (e.g. a user’s “active affiliation” is the tenant in which the user is  currently working) 
* **Central tenant**: The administrative tenant when Enhanced Consortial Support (ECS) is enabled.  
* **Client**: A library or a branch library. 
* **Consortium**: An association of independent libraries and/or library systems established by formal agreement, usually for the purpose of resource sharing. Membership may be restricted to a specific geographic region, type of library (public, academic, special), or subject specialization.
* **Enhanced Consortial Support (ECS)**: The underlying architecture that defines the relationship and interactions among multiple tenants.
* **Member**: An independent library’s or library system’s FOLIO tenant affiliated with a consortium in Consortium manager.
* **Permission**: A setting that allows users to perform specific functions in FOLIO. 
* **Permission set**: A set of individual permissions. 
* **Primary tenant**: A user’s home tenant; the tenant in which the user’s record was initially created in FOLIO. 
* **Shadow account**: A user record existing outside of a member’s primary tenant. A shadow account is automatically created when a user record is affiliated with a member library in the consortium that is not that user’s primary affiliation.
* **Shared**: Settings that are shared between member libraries and managed at the central consortium level (e.g. shared settings, shared Instances) 
* **Service Point**: A setting that libraries configure to support circulation functions. Each library must set up at least one service point. 
* **Tenant**: A FOLIO client whose data are stored separately and are accessible and visible separately from other FOLIO clients. 


## Permissions


The permissions listed below allow the user to interact with the Consortium manager app and determine what the user can and cannot do within the app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Consortium manager app or any related consortial information. 

For general information about permissions, see [Platform Essentials > Permissions](../platform-essentials/permissions/).


The following are the permissions for Consortium manager:


* **Consortia API module - all permissions.** This permission allows the user to use the Consortia API module to add or remove members in Consortium manager. 
* **Consortia: Assign and unassign affiliations.** This permission allows the user to add or remove affiliations of other users.
* **Consortia: View affiliations.** This permission allows the user to view the affiliations of other users.
* **Consortium manager: Can create, edit and remove settings.** This permission allows the user to perform build, create, edit and delete actions via the Consortia manager BUT the user must have the correct permissions in individual tenants to carry out these actions.
* **Consortium manager: Can share settings to all members.** This permission allows a user to create settings that will be shared by all members and is only editable in the central tenant.
* **Consortium manager: Can view existing settings.** This permission allows a user to view all the settings of members they are affiliated with via the consortia manager.
* **Inventory: Share local instance with consortium.** This permission allows a user to share local instance records with consortium members.


## Members


To view membership in **Consortium manager**, the user must be affiliated with the primary tenant of the consortium. To view membership, follow these steps: 


1. Select the primary tenant as the **active affiliation** in the top right corner if it is not already selected. 
    - To switch the **active affiliation**, click on the service point menu in the top right corner of the screen.
    - Select **switch active affiliation** in the drop-down menu. 
    - Select the primary member from the **Consortium members** menu. 
    - Click **Save & close**.
2. In the top navigation, click **Apps** and select **Consortium manager** from the drop down.
3. Towards the top right within Consortium manager, click on the **Select members** button. 
4. In the **Select members** window, the list of members in the consortia is displayed. 


Members cannot currently be added or removed in Consortium manager, but membership details can be edited. For more information about editing membership, see [Edit member details](../settings/settings_consortium-manager/settings_consortium-manager/#edit-member-details). 


## User type


User records include the same fields in all FOLIO tenants. However, **user type** is a required field for user records in an ECS-enabled environment. 


In Consortium manager, **user types** include: 


* **Staff**: Users who are employed by a library and must log into FOLIO to conduct library work. Staff accounts are assigned a primary tenant and a unique username. If the staff account is affiliated with multiple tenants, the username is used to log in at a single URL, and then use a drop down menu in the top right to change affiliation while logged in.
* **Patron**: Users who borrow library items. Patrons have user records in the Users app but do not log into FOLIO to manage their library accounts. They are assigned a primary tenant only and do not have any assigned affiliations or user permissions for other tenants in the consortium.
* **Shadow**: Shadow accounts serve as a representation of a user record and are automatically created by the FOLIO system in the central tenant whenever a staff user record is created. Shadow accounts display a user’s assigned permissions for a member tenant and allow management of permissions for the user record outside of the central tenant. If an affiliation is removed, the shadow account becomes inactive. If the staff user is deleted from their primary tenant, all of the user’s shadow accounts are also deleted from the member tenants.
* **System**: At least one system-level account must be in place in order to assign other roles and permissions. 


For more information about creating a new user record manually, see [Users \> Creating a user record manually](../users/#creating-a-user-record-manually). 


For more information about editing user records, see [User \> Edit a user record](../users/#edit-a-user-record). 


## Affiliations 


In an ECS-enabled tenant, each user must have an affiliation with at least one member library. The tenant in which the user record is initially created serves as the primary affiliation. When a user logs into FOLIO, the primary affiliation is set to active and displays in the top right corner of the screen. 


When working in an active affiliation, the local data in that tenant is displayed as well as any data shared across the consortium. 


### Assign an affiliation


When a user record is created in an ECS-enabled environment, the user is automatically affiliated with the tenant in which the user record was created. This affiliation is the user’s **primary affiliation**.


To assign an additional affiliation to a user record, follow these steps:


1. Login as an account which is already added to the affiliation you want to add to another user.  A user can assign or unassign other users to any affiliation that they themself are added to.  If a user is added to only one affiliation of a client library, then they will not see the **Affiliation** accordion while editing other users.
2. Starting from any affiliation (does not have to be the central tenant), search for the user record that you want to add to an affiliation. For more information, see [Users \> Search for user records](../users/#search-for-user-records). Select the user record. It will open in a new pane.
3. Click **Actions \> Edit** to edit the user record.
4. Open the **Affiliations** accordion. 
5. Click the **Assign/unassign** button.  
6. Check the box next to the **Name** of the member to assign the affiliation. One or more affiliations can be assigned in this step. 
7. Click **Save & close**.


### Unassign an affiliation


A user's **primary affiliation** and affiliation with the central tenant cannot be removed or changed, but affiliation with other members can be unassigned. Doing so sets the user’s status to **Inactive** for that member.


To unassign an affiliation with a member, follow these steps:


1. Login as an account which is already added to the affiliation you want to remove from another user.  A user can assign or unassign other users to any affiliation that they themself are added to.  If a user is added to only one affiliation of a client library, then they will not see the **Affiliation** accordion while editing other users.
2. Search for the user record. For more information, see [Users > Search for user records](../users/#search-for-user-records). Select the user record. It will open in a new pane.
3. Click **Actions \> Edit** to edit the user record.
4. Open the **Affiliations** accordion. The user’s primary affiliation appears in bold type.  
5. Click the **Assign/unassign** button. 
6. Find the member in the **Affiliations** window or use the **Search & filter** pane to search for a member or filter the list by **Affiliation assignment status**. 
7. Uncheck the box next to the **Name** of the member to unassign, or remove, the affiliation. One or more affiliations to member libraries, excluding the primary affiliation and affiliation with central tenant, can be unassigned in this step. 
8. Click **Save & close**.


### Assign or unassign user permissions for an affiliation


Users may be assigned permissions for any assigned affiliations. To manage user permissions for an affiliation, the process is similar to doing so for a user record in an individual tenant, except the **Affiliation** option is displayed in the **Permissions** accordion of the user record and the appropriate affiliation must be selected. For more information on assigning or unassigning permissions, see [Users \> Assign or unassign permissions](../users/#assign-or-unassign-permissions).


To assign affiliation permissions to a user record, go to the **Users** app and follow these steps:


1. Login as an account which is already added to the affiliation on which you want to edit a user's permissions.  If a user is added to only one affiliation of a client library, then they will not see the **Affiliation** accordion while editing other users, nor will they see the **Affiliation** drop down menu options while editing permissions on another user.
2. Search for the user record. For more information, see [Users \> Search for user records](../users/#search-for-user-records). Select the user record. It will open in a new pane.
3. Click **Actions \> Edit** to edit the user record.
4. Expand the **User permissions** accordion.
5. Select the affiliation you want to edit permissions in from the **Affiliation** drop-down menu. 
6. Click on **Add permissions**. 
7. Select the permission(s) to assign by checking the box next to the permission or permission set name. You can also search and filter for a permission or permission set in the **Search & filter** pane and check the box next to its name in the **Permissions** pane. 
8. Click **Save & close** to save the permissions to the user record. 


To remove affiliation permissions from a user’s record, go to the **Users** app and follow these steps: 


1. Login as an account which is already added to the affiliation on which you want to edit a user's permissions.  If a user is added to only one affiliation of a client library, then they will not see the **Affiliation** accordion while editing other users, nor will they see the **Affiliation** drop down menu options while editing permissions on another user.
2. Search for the user record. For more information, see [Users \> Search for user records](../users/#search-for-user-records) for user records. 
3. Select the user record. It will open in a new pane.
4. Click **Actions \> Edit**.
5. Expand the **User permissions** accordion.
6. Select the **Affiliation** in the Affiliation drop-down menu. 
7. Unassign permissions by any of these methods: 
* Click on the **X icon** next to a permission to remove the permission for that affiliation.
*  Or click on **Add permission** and uncheck the box next to **Name** in the **Permissions** window to unassign all of the permissions for that affiliation with one click.
* To remove all permissions for an affiliation, click on the **Unassign all permissions** button or [unassign the affiliation](#unassign-an-affiliation). All permissions are removed for that user in that member’s tenant.
7. Click **Save & close** to save the changes to the user record.


## Shared Settings


In **Consortium manager**, some settings can be modified and centrally managed for all member libraries through the **Share** option. By sharing settings, member libraries apply a controlled vocabulary to ensure consistency in library records and transactions across the consortium. Centralized controlled vocabularies can aid or enable search features in a federated search of all members, for example, by allowing a facet on search to work for all member records at the same time in a federated search environment.


The sharing option cannot be edited once the setting is initially created and saved. To change the sharing option in a setting, each of the relevant settings must first be deleted and then a new setting created with the appropriate sharing option. The **Share** option must be set when the setting is created and saved, and cannot be edited after the setting is initially saved. If **Share** is selected, the data fields, **Source**,  **Member libraries**, and **Update** display as **consortium**,  **ALL**, and **System Consortia**, respectively, indicating the setting can be managed in Consortium manager. 


If a setting is not shared, it serves as a local setting for a specific member library in the consortium regardless of which member tenant was used to create it. 


Shared settings are available in Consortium manager for these FOLIO apps:


* [**Circulation**](#circulation)
* [**Data Import**](#data-import)
* [**Data Export**](#data-export)
* [**Inventory**](#inventory)
* [**Users**](#users)
